A text-based adventure game made for my school assignment. This game lets you explore a mysterious clock tower full of puzzles, secrets and dangers. You can choose your own path, interact with different objects, and use your skills to solve challenges. The game is written entirely in Python and uses simple commands and inputs to control the gameplay.

To run this game, run "main.py" located in src and make sure all the libraries in "requirements.txt" are installed in your virtual environment.
